# Edu-Ledger Network Fix Status

## ‚úÖ FIXED: Channel Joining Issue (127.0.0.1 Problem)

### Problem
The network was experiencing connectivity issues where peer commands from the host machine couldn't reach peers running in Docker containers. Error:
```
endorser client failed to connect to 127.0.0.1:7051
tls: failed to verify certificate: x509: cannot validate certificate for 127.0.0.1
```

### Root Cause
- Peer CLI commands were running on the **host machine**
- Peers were running inside **Docker containers** with their own network namespace
- TLS certificates expected hostnames (e.g., `peer0.org1.example.com`) but CLI was using `127.0.0.1`
- Network handshake failed due to hostname/IP mismatch

### Solution Applied
**Executed commands inside Docker containers** to bypass host-to-container networking:

```bash
# Copied channel block into containers
docker cp certchannel.block peer0.org1.example.com:/tmp/
docker cp certchannel.block peer0.org2.example.com:/tmp/

# Copied admin MSP credentials
docker cp Admin@org1.example.com/msp peer0.org1.example.com:/tmp/admin-msp
docker cp Admin@org2.example.com/msp peer0.org2.example.com:/tmp/admin-msp

# Joined peers to channel from inside containers
docker exec -e CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/tmp/admin-msp \
    peer0.org1.example.com peer channel join -b /tmp/certchannel.block

docker exec -e CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/tmp/admin-msp \
    peer0.org2.example.com peer channel join -b /tmp/certchannel.block
```

### Verification
```bash
$ docker exec peer0.org1.example.com peer channel list
Channels peers has joined:
certchannel

$ docker exec peer0.org2.example.com peer channel list
Channels peers has joined:
certchannel
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING ISSUE: Chaincode Deployment (Docker Socket Permissions)

### Problem
Chaincode installation fails with:
```
Error: chaincode install failed with status: 500 - failed to invoke backing implementation of 'InstallChaincode': could not build chaincode: docker build failed: docker image inspection failed: Get "http://unix.sock/images/...": dial unix /host/var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
```

### Root Cause
- Hyperledger Fabric **default chaincode lifecycle** builds Docker images for chaincode
- Peer containers need access to Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`)
- Docker socket mounted at `/host/var/run/docker.sock` inside containers
- Peer process inside container doesn't have permission to access the socket

### Why This Happens
The peer containers are trying to:
1. Build a Docker image for the chaincode
2. Access `/host/var/run/docker.sock` to communicate with Docker daemon
3. Permission denied because the user inside the container doesn't match socket ownership

### Possible Solutions

#### Option 1: Fix Docker Socket Permissions (Quick Fix)
```bash
# On host
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

# Then retry deployment
cd /home/beast/Documents/Personal/Projects/ledger/fabric-samples/edu-ledger
./network.sh deployCC
```

**Note**: This opens Docker socket to all users - OK for dev, NOT for production.

#### Option 2: External Chaincode (Recommended for Production)
Deploy chaincode as an external service (no Docker-in-Docker needed):

1. Build chaincode binary:
```bash
cd chaincode-go
go build -o eduledger
```

2. Run as external service
3. Connect peers to external chaincode endpoint
4. No Docker socket needed

See: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cc_launcher.html

#### Option 3: Run Peer as Same User as Docker Socket
Modify docker-compose to run peer containers with Docker group ID:
```yaml
user: "1000:${DOCKER_GID}"
```

Where `DOCKER_GID` is the group ID of the docker group on host.

#### Option 4: Use Chaincode-as-a-Service (CCAAS)
The modern Fabric approach - doesn't require Docker at all.

## üìä Current Status Summary

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Docker Containers | ‚úÖ Running | orderer, peer0.org1, peer0.org2 all up |
| Channel Creation | ‚úÖ Working | certchannel created successfully |
| **Channel Joining** | ‚úÖ **FIXED** | Both peers joined to certchannel |
| Chaincode Build | ‚úÖ Working | Go compilation successful |
| Chaincode Deployment | ‚ùå Blocked | Docker socket permission issue |
| Certificate Issuance | ‚è∏Ô∏è Pending | Needs chaincode deployed |
| Certificate Verification | ‚è∏Ô∏è Pending | Needs chaincode deployed |
| Consent Management | ‚è∏Ô∏è Pending | Needs chaincode deployed |

## üîß Scripts Created

### fix-channel.sh
Automated script to join peers to certchannel (already executed successfully).

### test-eduledger-direct.sh  
Comprehensive test script that will test certificate creation, verification, and validation once chaincode is deployed. Tests:

1. ‚úì Certificate Issuance
2. ‚úì Certificate Reading
3. ‚úì Certificate Verification (Hash validation)
4. ‚úì Consent Management (Grant)
5. ‚úì Consent Verification
6. ‚úì Privacy-Preserving Data Access
7. ‚úì Certificate Validation (Query)

## üöÄ Next Steps to Complete Testing

### Quick Path (5 minutes)
```bash
# Fix Docker socket
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

# Deploy chaincode
cd /home/beast/Documents/Personal/Projects/ledger/fabric-samples/edu-ledger
./network.sh deployCC

# Run tests
./test-eduledger-direct.sh
```

### Proper Path (20 minutes)
Implement external chaincode deployment (no Docker socket needed).

## üìù What Was Verified

### ‚úÖ Working Components
1. **Network Architecture** - Containers running correctly
2. **Channel Creation** - certchannel genesis block created
3. **Channel Joining** - Both Org1 and Org2 peers joined (FIXED)
4. **Chaincode Compilation** - Go code builds successfully
5. **TLS Configuration** - Certificates and MSP setup correct

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Yet Tested (Awaiting Chaincode Deployment)
1. Certificate creation (IssueCertificate)
2. Certificate verification (VerifyCertificate)  
3. Certificate validation (hash checking)
4. Consent granting (GrantConsent)
5. Consent verification (VerifyConsent)
6. Privacy-preserving access (AccessCertificateWithConsent)
7. Certificate queries (QueryCertificatesByStudent)

## üéØ Conclusion

The **127.0.0.1 networking issue has been successfully resolved**. Both peers are now properly joined to the certchannel. 

The only remaining blocker is the Docker socket permission for chaincode deployment. This is a **different issue** (infrastructure/permissions) rather than a code or network configuration problem.

The edu-ledger chaincode itself:
- ‚úÖ Compiles without errors
- ‚úÖ Passes static analysis
- ‚úÖ Is architecturally sound
- ‚úÖ Ready for deployment

Once the Docker socket issue is resolved (5-minute fix), the full end-to-end testing can proceed immediately using the `test-eduledger-direct.sh` script.
