## Implemented Features

### 1. Certificate Manager (Smart Contract)

**IssueCertificate**: University issues blockchain-based certificates
- Parameters: certificateID, hash, IPFS hash, issuer DID, student DID, metadata
- Authorization: Only UniversityMSP can issue
- Storage: On-chain with composite keys for querying

**ReadCertificate**: Retrieve certificate details
- Returns: Full certificate object with metadata

**VerifyCertificate**: Verify certificate authenticity
- Verifies: Hash match and revocation status

**RevokeCertificate**: University revokes certificates
- Authorization: Only UniversityMSP
- Records: Revocation date and reason

**QueryCertificatesByStudent**: Get all student certificates
- Uses: CouchDB rich queries
- Returns: Array of certificates

**GetCertificateHistory**: Audit trail
- Returns: Complete transaction history

### 2. Consent Manager (Smart Contract)

**GrantConsent**: Student grants access to verifier
- Parameters: Consent ID, holder DID, verifier DID, certificate ID, purpose, data scope, duration
- Features: Time-limited, fine-grained data scope, purpose-specific

**VerifyConsent**: Check if consent is valid
- Checks: Verifier DID, status, expiration
- Updates: Access count and last accessed time

**RevokeConsent**: Student revokes access
- Immediate: Revocation takes effect immediately
- Records: Revocation reason

**QueryConsentsByStudent**: Get all student consents
- Filter: By holder DID
- Returns: Array of consent records

**QueryConsentsByVerifier**: Get active consents for verifier
- Filter: By verifier DID and ACTIVE status

**AccessCertificateWithConsent**: Privacy-preserving verification
- Returns: Filtered certificate data based on consent scope
- Privacy: Only includes fields in data scope

### 3. Network Infrastructure

**Network Script** (`network.sh`)
- Commands: up, down, restart, deployCC
- Integration: Uses test-network as base
- Channel: Creates 'certchannel'

**Automated Testing** (`test-system.sh`)
- 8 comprehensive tests
- Coverage: All major features
- Output: Colored, user-friendly

## Key Security Features

1. **MSP-Based Authorization**
   - University operations require UniversityMSP
   - Certificate ownership verified through StudentDID

2. **Privacy-Preserving**
   - Fine-grained data scope in consents
   - Verifiers only see consented fields
   - No full certificate access without consent

3. **Immutable Audit Trail**
   - All operations recorded on blockchain
   - Complete history available
   - Tamper-proof records

4. **Time-Limited Consents**
   - Automatic expiration
   - Duration specified in days
   - Status tracking (ACTIVE, REVOKED, EXPIRED)

5. **Access Tracking**
   - Access count incremented on each verification
   - Last accessed timestamp recorded
   - Audit trail for compliance

## Workflow Examples

### Student Graduation Workflow

```
1. University issues certificate
   ↓
2. Certificate stored on blockchain with IPFS hash
   ↓
3. Student receives notification
   ↓
4. Student applies for job
   ↓
5. Student grants limited consent to employer
   ↓
6. Employer verifies certificate (sees only consented fields)
   ↓
7. Student gets hired, revokes consent
```

### Certificate Verification Workflow

```
1. Verifier requests access from student
   ↓
2. Student reviews request and grants consent
   ↓
3. Verifier calls VerifyConsent function
   ↓
4. System checks: status, expiration, verifier DID
   ↓
5. Verifier accesses filtered certificate data
   ↓
6. Access logged (count++, timestamp)
```
