# Enhanced Certificate Management System - New Features

## Overview
The certificate management system has been enhanced with dynamic student account management, PDF certificate uploads with IPFS storage, and improved consent-based access control.

## New Features

### 1. Dynamic Student Account Management

#### Issuer Can Create Student Accounts
- Issuers can now create student accounts with custom usernames and passwords
- Each student gets a unique wallet upon registration
- Students can login with their credentials to access their certificates

#### How It Works:
```
Issuer Dashboard > Add Student Tab
- Enter: Username, Password, Full Name
- System creates: User account + Wallet
- Student can immediately login
```

#### Example:
```python
Username: alice_s01
Password: alice123
Full Name: Alice Johnson
Wallet: Generated automatically (RSA 2048-bit)
```

### 2. PDF Certificate Upload with IPFS

#### Certificate PDF Storage
- Issuers can upload PDF certificates when issuing
- PDFs are stored locally and assigned IPFS hashes
- Each PDF is digitally signed by the issuer

#### IPFS Hash Generation
- Simulated IPFS hash using SHA-256
- Format: Qm[base32-encoded hash]
- Stored in blockchain for verification

#### Digital PDF Signatures
- PDFs signed using issuer's private key
- RSA-PSS with SHA-256
- Signature stored alongside certificate

#### Workflow:
```
1. Issuer uploads PDF
2. System reads PDF content
3. Generates IPFS hash (Qm...)
4. Signs PDF with issuer private key
5. Stores PDF in /tmp/certificates/
6. Records IPFS hash and signature in blockchain
```

### 3. Enhanced Certificate Issuance

#### Smart Student Detection
The system now intelligently handles student accounts during certificate issuance:

**Scenario 1: Existing Student**
```
- Provide student full name
- Select existing username
- Certificate linked to existing account
```

**Scenario 2: New Student**
```
- Provide student full name
- Enter new username and password
- System creates student account
- Certificate issued to new account
```

**Scenario 3: Auto-detect**
```
- Provide only student name
- System searches for existing account
- If not found, prompts for credentials
```

### 4. Student-Specific Features

#### Login with Custom Credentials
- Students login with their unique username/password
- System tracks current logged-in user
- Certificates shown based on logged-in student

#### View Own Certificates
- Students see only their certificates
- Includes blockchain hash, signatures, IPFS hash
- PDF availability indicated

#### Download Certificate PDFs
- Students can download their PDF certificates
- Available directly from the dashboard
- Works seamlessly with Gradio file component

### 5. Consent-Based PDF Access

#### HR Can View PDFs Only with Consent
- HR must have active student consent
- PDF path provided only if consent granted
- Maintains privacy and control

#### Workflow:
```
1. Student grants consent for specific certificate
2. HR requests certificate details
3. System checks consent status
4. If granted: Shows details + PDF download
5. If denied: Shows "Access Denied" message
```

### 6. Enhanced Blockchain Records

#### Certificates Now Include:
```json
{
  "cert_id": "CERT-0001",
  "student_name": "Alice Johnson",
  "student_username": "alice_s01",
  "course": "Computer Science",
  "grade": "A+",
  "issue_date": "2025-10-26",
  "issuer": "issuer324",
  "blockchain_hash": "00f07abe03e2d95b...",
  "ipfs_hash": "QmBGGEM7ZNYW7HFLRKAU2DQ5QX2YW3KVU...",
  "pdf_signature": "ThNYPTWqZL+lktPJ3WlZzbr24PVayeTB...",
  "signatures": [{
    "signer": "issuer324",
    "signature": "wfomxYrnuZI7mJlrecXiqiF99DWT0gCZ...",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-26T23:56:45.123456"
  }]
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Student Storage
```python
# Students stored in system.users
{
  "alice_s01": {
    "password": "alice123",
    "role": "student",
    "name": "Alice Johnson"
  }
}

# Wallets auto-generated
system.wallets["alice_s01"] = Wallet("alice_s01")
```

### Certificate Storage
```python
# Certificates indexed by username
system.student_certificates = {
  "alice_s01": ["CERT-0001", "CERT-0002"],
  "bob_s02": ["CERT-0003"]
}
```

### PDF Storage
```
Location: /tmp/certificates/
Format: {CERT_ID}.pdf
Example: /tmp/certificates/CERT-0001.pdf
```

### IPFS Hash Generation
```python
def generate_ipfs_hash(file_content: bytes) -> str:
    hash_obj = hashlib.sha256(file_content)
    return "Qm" + base64.b32encode(hash_obj.digest()).decode()[:44]
```

### PDF Signing
```python
# Sign PDF with issuer's private key
pdf_hash = hashlib.sha256(pdf_content).hexdigest()
pdf_signature = issuer_wallet.sign_data(pdf_hash)
```

## Security Features

### 1. Access Control
- Students can only view their own certificates
- HR requires explicit consent for each certificate
- Issuers can manage all students and certificates

### 2. PDF Authentication
- PDFs signed by issuer
- Signatures verifiable using blockchain

- Status tracked (active/revoked)
- Timestamp recorded
- Consent required for PDF access

### 4. Blockchain Immutability
- All certificates recorded in blockchain
- Proof-of-work mining
- Chain validation ensures integrity
